## Introduction

In this project assignment, you will be working on a dataset from the **Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS)** website. The dataset contains information on the workers' compensation insurance industry in the United States. The dataset includes data on premiums, losses, and expenses for various years.

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to analyze and model workers’ compensation claims data using the `wkcomp_pos` dataset. You will explore patterns in incurred and paid losses, understand how they develop over time, and build a predictive model for cumulative paid losses using regression techniques.

## Deliverables

1.  Report detailing:

-   Your data exploration process and key insights.
-   The regression model and its interpretation.
-   Model evaluation and assumptions check.
-   Optional: comparison between the linear model and the advanced model (e.g., GAM).

2.  R Code used for the analysis, clearly documented and structured.

## Learning Outcomes

-   Gain experience with real-world workers’ compensation data.
-   Develop proficiency in data manipulation and visualization using tidyverse.
-   Build and evaluate regression models for loss prediction.
-   Understand the importance of model assumptions and how to check them visually.

## Tasks

The project assignment is divided into four main tasks:

1.  **Data Exploration**: Load the dataset, check for missing values, and visualize key relationships.
2.  **Modeling the Loss Development**: Create a regression model to predict cumulative paid losses.
3.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as R-squared, RMSE, and AIC.
4.  **Advanced Modeling (Optional)**: Try an advanced model (e.g., GAM) and compare its performance to the linear model.
