## Introduction to Predictive Modeling

In the first lesson of this course, we learned about the basics of R and how to perform basic data analysis. In this lesson, we will delve deeper into predictive modeling and practice using R functions in various actuarial contexts. We will also learn how to manage CSV files, explore R packages for data analysis, and apply our knowledge to a practical project.

## Learning Objectives

-   Utilize statistical modeling and simulation techniques
-   Make R functions to use in various actuarial contests
-   Practice managing csv files
-   Learn about R packages for data analysis
-   Apply learned R functions and concepts to a practical project

R is particularly suited for predictive modeling in actuarial work because it supports complex statistical analysis, has a vast collection of libraries (`glm`, `rpart`, `randomForest`, `survival`), and offers extensive visualization tools to communicate results effectively. Traditional statistical methods (like GLMs) and modern machine learning techniques (like Gradient Boosted Trees - GBMs and decision trees), can be implemented all within the same environment.

### Examples

-   Building a linear regression model to predict a companyâ€™s sales based on advertising spend.
-   Using a decision tree to classify whether a customer will churn based on demographic and behavioral data.
