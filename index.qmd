## Course Description

This course is designed to equip you with the technical skills to use R in actuarial science. You’ll gain the necessary knowledge to succeed in the rapidly evolving world of risk analysis, insurance, and finance. Throughout the program, you’ll discover the power of R, one of the most widely-used programming languages in statistics and actuarial science, for performing essential tasks like pricing, reserving, and risk management.

Whether you’re just starting out or looking to enhance your current skill set, this course offers a comprehensive approach to understanding actuarial concepts, from data manipulation and visualization to advanced statistical modeling. Our lessons will take you step-by-step through real-world applications, providing hands-on experience with the types of challenges actuaries face every day.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

-   Build and analyze actuarial models using R.
-   Apply statistical methods to pricing, reserving, and risk management.
-   Interpret and visualize data to inform key business decisions.
-   Use predictive analytics to forecast trends and outcomes.

## Prerequisites

This program is designed for both aspiring and experienced actuaries who want to deepen their expertise in data analysis and programming.
