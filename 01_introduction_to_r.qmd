## Introduction to R Programming Environment

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language and statistical development environment widely used for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling. It is an open-source language that provides a wide range of functions and packages specific to data processing and statistics.

R is particularly popular among statisticians, data analysts, and data scientists due to its power and flexibility in data processing and analysis. It comes with numerous statistical functions, data manipulation capabilities, and visualization tools, making it a versatile tool for exploring and analyzing data.

[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that provides a user-friendly interface for writing, executing, and managing R code. It offers features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and project management, making it easier to work with R.

## Resources

In case you get stuck or you just want to learn more about R, here are some resources to help you along the way:

-   `help.start()`
-   `?syntax`

(hint. substitute syntax with your function)

You can open a help page for any object that comes with R or with an R package. To open the help page, type a `?` before the object's name and then run the command.
